# Codeverse Gulp Registry
Company-wide Gulp tasks for legacy projects.

## Installation

To install for use in your project:

    npm install --save-dev @codeverse/gulp-registry

## Usage

Add these lines near the top of your `gulpfile`:

        var codeverseTasks = require('@codeverse/gulp-registry');
        gulp.registry(codeverseTasks);

### Configuration

The tasks contained herein are configured by entries in each project's `package.json`. See
[`src/config.json`](src/config.json) for example configuration options; although most will be
automatically deduced from the usual contents of `package.json`.

### Changelog
I really should be generating this programmatically.

#### v0.100

Breaking changes include further updating of developer tools, and a new config format:

 - (new) Upgrading from Babel v6 era to v7 era tools

    See: <https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/v7-migration>; notably, `.babelrc` files may need to be
    updated as follows, after replacing the `babel-preset-env` package with the scoped
    `@babel/preset-env` package:

    ```diff
    diff --git a/.babelrc b/.babelrc
    --- a/.babelrc
    +++ b/.babelrc
    @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
     {
    -  "presets": ["env"]
    +  "presets": ["@babel/env"]
     }
    ```

 - (new dep) Upgrading from Webpack v3 -> v4

   See: <https://webpack.js.org/migrate/4/>

   Webpack no longer builds minified builds side-by-side. This will require some thought in the
   future; but for now, I've enabled the new `'production'` mode for our builds. This means, for
   instance, that `dist/fooProject.min.js` is now just `dist/fooProject.js`

 - (new dep) Detecting webworkers with a more general pattern

   Instead of matching specifically `src/worker.js` (tightly-coupled to `physics-engine`), now any
   file in `directories.src` with an extension of `*.worker.js` will be passed thru `worker-loader`.

 - (new config) Replace milk.json with package.json for config

   Most of the tasks as-written didn't actually *use* the configuration that the README previously
   claimed you could use, and none of our internal projects seem to actually use these options.
   Nonetheless, configuration is now done via the standard `package.json` fields.

   One particular breaking change with the configuration, is that the package-name is now used
   (after camelCasing) as the default variable under which to expose the entry package â€” for
   instance, what was previously `new global['physics-engine'].Creator(...)` will now be exposed as
   `new physicsEngine.Creator(...)`. (FIXME: This should be `PhysicsEngine`, oops!)

#### v0.99

First release. Migrates the Gulp used in the legacy `milk-carton` to Gulp `v4`; see below for
migration instructions.

### Migrating from Milk Carton `~v0.0.x` to @codeverse/gulp-registry `>=v0.100.0`
Gulp 4.0.0 fundamentally changed the architecture of Gulp tasks, in such a way as to make a
"forked-gulp" CLI tool infeasible. If a project's current npm `"scripts"` use `milk` commands, you
can upgrade to Gulp 4 as follows:

1. Switch to this project:

        npm uninstall milk-carton
        npm install --save-dev gulp@4 @codeverse/gulp-registry
        npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env
        npm install --global gulp-cli # If you haven't done so previously

2. Add a bare Gulpfile with contents analogous to the following:

        // Gulpfile.babel.js
        var gulp = require('gulp');
        var codeverseTasks = require('@codeverse/gulp-registry');
        
        gulp.registry(codeverseTasks);
        
        // Set up some sort of default task; as an example,
        export default gulp.series('lint', 'build', 'test');

3. Add at least a skeletal `.babelrc` to allow the Gulpfile to be written in modern syntax:

        {
          "presets": ["@babel/env"]
        }

4. Replace the npm scripts in `package.json`; `milk X` can simply become `gulp X`.
